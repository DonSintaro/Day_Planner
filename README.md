# Day_Planner



This is a day player that can schedule activities to do for the time period of the day.  It will auto color coordinate timings for specific textboxes for planning purposes and allow the user to save entries into the textboxes for the day.  It will autoclear at the loading of a new day.  

I unfortunately didn't have time to style the html better with my inner artist due to time constraints and full time working but I still made it reasonable to look at using bootstrap.
